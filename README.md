My solutions (or attempts, at least) for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenge.

I won't claim to have solved all of these without assistance. In most cases I was able to get the right idea but had to look for hints when it came to dealing with edge cases and the like. For some of the harder puzzles, I made use of some very helpful YouTube streams to see how the problem should be approached.
