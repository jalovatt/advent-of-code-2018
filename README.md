My solutions (or attempts, at least) for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenge.

I won't claim to have solved all of these without assistance. In most cases I've come up with the right idea but often had to look for hints when it came to dealing with edge cases, time complexity issues, and the like. For some of the harder puzzles, I made use of some very helpful YouTube walkthroughs to see what sort of logic/structure was necessary before working out the details on my own.
